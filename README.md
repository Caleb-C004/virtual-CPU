# virtual-CPU
Virtual java program that emulates a basic memory traversal and cpu runtime 

This program runs on 3 files CPU, Memory, and Stack with an input file input.txt

The CPU files aims to emulate the basic funtions of a cpu through calculating and numbers and sending for memory locations

Memory serves as the holding place for the code from input.txt as well as hosting the main function

Stack stores the CPU's register states in a stack whenever a subroutine is called for the CPU
